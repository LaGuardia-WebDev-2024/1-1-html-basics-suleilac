<h1>
   Small
  </h1>

  <p>
    
  </p>Confused and bewildered <br>
  How did I get so hurt <br>
  Feeling just so <em>small</em> <br> 
  Maybe thats all <br>
  That you wanted <br>
   <em>To sit and watch me  fall</em> <br> <br>
  Day after day <br>
Playing round with my brain <br>
  Knowing if you could choose <br>
  It'd be her and you knew <br>
  But you stalled <br> 
  To make me feel so <strong><em>small</em></strong> <br>
